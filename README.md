# ML-Stock-Prediction

Guided project on stock forecasting, using this notebook to test.


Notes:
The ML algorithm was able to put out a confidence value of 0.99157875 when testing on a data set of 'AAPL' stock prices acquired from Quandl


A good method of training and testing data is to use 80% of the data to train and 20% to test. Using the train_test_split function simplifies that portion


Linear Regression model is not an accurate method of predicting stock prices and should not be used with real investments


This application is using a line of best fit as reference, however, most stock movements cannot be represented linearly



Future projects and ideas:


    - Create functionality of being able to input any ticker on NASDAQ to create a 30-Day forecast
    
    
    - Create a function that takes a list of tickers (NASDAQ) and ranks the list of tickers in order of total yield percent (+ to -)
    
    
    - Instead of using a Linear Regression model, try a different model that instead of values, predicts risk (Power Laws)
